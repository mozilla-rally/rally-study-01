  reasons:
    attention: |
      An attention event is an instance where the user
      was actively using the browser in an active tab
      in an active window.
    audio: |
      An audio event tells us when an active browser
      tab has audio playing. We use this as a proxy
      for a user passively consuming audio and video.
